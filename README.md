# NSS-PRESENTATION

1. We identify the heavy use of Adobe Flash as a way of retrieving more sensi- tive information from a client, including the ability to detect HTTP proxies, and the existence of intrusive fingerprinting plugins that users may unknowingly host in their browsers.
   
2. Second, we measure the adoption of fingerprinting on the Internet and show that, in many cases, sites of dubious nature fingerprint their users, for a variety of purposes
3. Third, we investigate special JavaScript-accessible browser objects, such as navigator and screen, and describe novel fingerprinting techniques that can accurately identify a browser even down to its minor version. These techniques involve the ordering of methods and properties, detection of vendor-specific methods, HTML/CSS functionality as well as minor but fingerprintable implementation choices.
4. Lastly, we examine and test browser extensions that are available for users who wish to spoof the identity of their browser and show that, unfortunately all fail to completely hide the browserâ€™s true identity. This incomplete coverage not only voids the extensions but, ironically, also allows fingerprinting companies to detect the fact that user is attempting to hide, adding extra fingerprintable information.
